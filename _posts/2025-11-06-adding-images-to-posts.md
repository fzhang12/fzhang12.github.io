This post demonstrates how to add images to your Jekyll blog posts.

## Basic Image Syntax

Here's how you add an image using markdown:

![Workflow diagram](/assets/images/workflow-diagram.jpg)

The syntax is: `![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)`

## Why Images Matter

Images can help illustrate your points, make your posts more engaging, and break up long blocks of text. In bioinformatics, images are especially useful for:

- Showing data visualizations
- Displaying workflow diagrams
- Illustrating concepts with diagrams
- Sharing screenshots of tools or results

## Tips for Using Images

1. **Always include descriptive alt text** - This helps with accessibility and SEO
2. **Optimize your images** - Large files slow down your site
3. **Use appropriate formats** - JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics
4. **Keep images organized** - Store them in `assets/images/`
